# Massive Multiplayer Online

Massive multiplayer is a application that I developed for one of my university assignments which runs in distributed system. To play this game the user have to be a registered user. This game allows users to log in and select any server (and see friends playing in the server) and defeat the boss of the game by selecting the desired hero.
